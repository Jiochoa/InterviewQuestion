## Intro
The purpose of this is to find ways to get the most out of ChatGPT 4.0 or in other words, Artificial Intelligence. I have some ideas on how to use it properly so I will catalog and tests them and redefine them if needed. 

<u>End Goal</u>
The end goal is to be much more productive than I am now

<u>General Purpose Ideas</u>
- Act as an expert in { whatever technology I'm currently using } and answer me some questions. I want the answers to be in simple terms.

<u>Specific Projects Ideas</u>
1. Specify exactly the technology I'm using along with any outside libraries I might want to use.
	- i.e. Kotlin, Kotlin build kts plus Material something like that
2. Specify exactly what I'm trying to do, So they have a better understanding of where the questions are headed.
	- i.e. I'm trying to build an application.
3. Specify exactly what I want it to do. 
	- I want you to provide me with working code
4. Maybe provide the whole code?

<u>What I need to know for a specific project</u>
I need to have a good understanding of the structure of the project. (i.e. `onCreate()`, `onClick()`, `onEnd()`) Might want to use excalidraw for structure checkups. How is the code being executed, what executes first, 


## Experiment number 1

**Objective**
Make an simple app from start to finish. The app is meant to be simple but complete with unit testing. The app is going to be a replica of Tetris.

1. Technology I'm going to use
	- Kotlin app using minimum SDK of API 29 Android 10.0, with the Kotlin DSL built configuration language
	- 
1. What is the app about
2. what do I want from the AI
3. Here is the start up code
