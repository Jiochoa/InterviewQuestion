I'm trying to learn how to make apps with `Kotlin` as a programming language and `jetpack Compose` for the styling and graphics. No more XML files.

First I'll do some navigation basics.

## Navigation basics

After this lecture I should have the following questions answered.
Question:
- How do you move from one screen to another
- How do you save the state of the screen you are moving from
- How to send data from one screen to another


### How do you move from one screen to another
You need a Navigation Controller, `navController`, and a Navigation Graph `NavGraph`, and to set up the routes you can take. Usually on a routes file

### How do you save the state of the screen you are moving from


### How to send data from one screen to another
