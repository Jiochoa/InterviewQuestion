This is going to be a quick game, mostly because I'm running out of time so I will focus only on what I already have and use that to make a fun game but most of what's going to suffer is in the story telling of the game. The art seems fine so I will still use that, though I still need to make more for level variation. 

I'm going to try to do 10 levels and every 2 levels the theme of the game will have to change, so that gives me 5 themes that I need to work on.
### Story
As stated there will not be a story, just a cohesive progression. Meaning first a city theme then something that naturally follows a city.
#### Level 1: City (parking lot)
The player will come out of a door and that's where the game will start. The cat will run trough some obstacles including cars to jump and to crouch under as well as stacks of cars to climb up and reach the end of the parking lot which will trigger an animation for an elevator which is where the level will end.

**Intro Cutscene:**
The player will just walk outside following a butterfly. The butterfly will then escape as the player begins to approach.

**Exit Cutscene:**
The player will reach the end of the parking lot and enter an elevator that will go down for a little of sightseeing as the opening credits begin to roll.

**Features:**
- introduce run / sprint
- introduce jump / double jump
- introduce crouch
#### Level 2: City (some street)
The player will come out of the parking lot into a crowded street which is where the level will start. There will be cars which the player has to avoid as well as some toxic waste that can also kill you. The last building will be under construction at least at the entrance so the player will have to climb up a chain to get to the second floor, which is where the 3rd level will start.

#### Level 3: Building (Apartment)
As the player gets inside the apartment that's where the level will start. The apartment will have security Roombas going all around the floor making it hard for the player to move. The player will have to use the curtains as nets to move around as well as moving platforms (window cleaners) to get to the end of the level. The next room will be the living room which is where the family will be so you have to avoid them also, to do that you will have to get on the chandelier and jump your way over them to reach the window which is where the level will end.

The screen will then darken and the credits will begin to roll.

**Features:**
- introduce none







I still have no idea what is going on with the game, it seems that I might have missed some important basic things. I might have to take one of those tutorials. Also, I need to start the video tutorial on how to use the `2D Character Controller` 

As for now I need to decide if I want the coin base system or something else like just a simple runner game. Which is not too bad but I would need to do a lot more of art since there's no going back to pick up coins.
