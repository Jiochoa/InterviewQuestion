This is going to be a quick game, mostly because I'm running out of time so I will focus only on what I already have and use that to make a fun game but most of what's going to suffer is in the story telling of the game. The art seems fine so I will still use that, though I still need to make more for level variation. 

I'm going to try to do 10 levels and every 2 levels the theme of the game will have to change, so that gives me 5 themes that I need to work on.
### Story
As stated there will not be a story, just a cohesive progression. Meaning first a city theme then something that naturally follows a city.
#### Level 1: city (parking lot)
The player will come out of a door and that's where the game will start. The cat will run trough some obstacles yet to be decided and reach the end of the parking lot which is where the level will end.

**Features:**
- introduce run / sprint
- introduce jump / double jump
- introduce crouch
#### Level 2: city (some street)
The player will come out of the parking lot into a crowded street which is where the level will start. There will be acid puddles around which the player has to avoid. There will also be moving radioactive trash piles which the player will have to cross using moving platforms. The player will enter an apartment trough a window which is where the level will end.

**Features:**
- introduce death zones
- introduce moving platforms
#### Level 3: Building (Apartment 1)
As the player gets inside the apartment that's where the level will start. The apartment will have security Roombas going all around the floor making it hard for the player to move. The player will have to use the curtains as nets to move around as well as moving platforms (window cleaners) to get to the end of the level. The player will enter another apartment which is where the level will end.

**Features:**
- introduce moving death zones
- introduce nets (window curtains)
#### Level 4: Building (Apartment 2)
As the player enters the apartment 2 that where the level will start. The player will have to avoid

#### Level 5: Building Side (Apartment 3)

#### Level 6: Building Side (emergency ladder)

#### Level 7: Building roof (roof setup)

#### Level 8: Building roof (Zipline ad flags)

#### Level 9: Factory (floor 1)
#### Level 10: Factory (floor 2)

I still have no idea what is going on with the game, it seems that I might have missed some important basic things. I might have to take one of those tutorials. Also, I need to start the video tutorial on how to use the `2D Character Controller` 

As for now I need to decide if I want the coin base system or something else like just a simple runner game. Which is not too bad but I would need to do a lot more of art since there's no going back to pick up coins.
