Change of plans: 


## Player
The player is going to be a simple street cat. No special abilities yet, maybe later I'm still not sure.


### Movements
The movements will include any motions that can be done in an empty space like:

- [ ] MOVE
	- [ ] Code
		- [ ] walk
		- [ ] run
		- [ ] sprint
		- [ ] jump
		- [ ] crawl
	- [ ] Animations
		- [ ] walk
		- [ ] run
		- [ ] sprint
		- [ ] jump
		- [ ] crawl

### Interactions
The interactions will include any motions that can be done either with the level or with objects in the level, like:
- [ ] `wall jumping`
- [ ] `wall slide`
- [ ] `climbing ledges`
- [ ] `ledge hanging`
- [ ] `rope swing`
- [ ] `pull`
- [ ] `push`

### Abilities 
The abilities will include anything that is not natural to a cat like with cybernetics like:
- [ ] `double jump`
- [ ] `shoot lazers`
- [ ] `sonar`


## Tutorial
1. Setting up the project
	- Install Unity
	- download asset
2. What's in it
	- Structure of the project
	- What can you do with it
3. How to adjust it to your needs
4. Adding your Sprites
5. Adding UI:
	- Start Menu / 
	- Intro Screen/ Credit Screen
	- 

**Questions to answer:**
1. How are abilities being used
2. Where is the Jump button being processed


**What I'm trying to do:**
The ability modules follow a certain order. I made a test print to see what's being ran first.

Look for other modules that also interact with a game object and copy their procedure.
