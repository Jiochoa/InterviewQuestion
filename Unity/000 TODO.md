## What will i do right now
The plan for today will be to finish the UI including how the items interact with the player i.e. Player picking up batteries and the meter filling in the right direction.

- need full battery Sprite
- need joystick sprites off-center

- need cat swimming

## The Plan
Bit of a change in pace since i getting board and I feel i need some variation.

- Interview questions
- Learning something new in Unity[^2]
- The Game
- Learning something in Unreal Engine [^1]

### Interview Questions
I'm going to start my day, hopefully before working out, with an interview question to learn remind myself of java and design patterns and what not. to make it more specific, I will try to finish the problem in the first hour then the last half hour I'm going to simulate an interview question. i might record it just to make it more realistic. 

### Workout
Then right after, I'm going to go for a run then the gym. 

### Learning Unity
After that, I'm going to try to learn something Unity related. Anything. This will give me some time to rest my legs as well as to learn something useful that I might still use for the game.

### The Game
After that, I'm going to continue with the game, this includes the art and I'm going to try to do it standing because its very difficult to work while sitting. 

###  Learning Unreal Engine
And Lastly, I will look a little into Unreal Engine since that is my target engine for the Jobs I want to apply to after I'm done with the game.
