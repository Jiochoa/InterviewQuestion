## What will i do right now
The plan for tomorrow:
Make a Aseprite for every level. from top to bottom how It should look. Its important to have something to aim for and this will be it. Il do it in one file so it doesnt take too much space but it will have a lot of things.
 



## The Plan
Bit of a change in pace since i getting board and I feel i need some variation.

- Interview questions
- Learning something new in Unity[^2]
- The Game
- Learning something in Unreal Engine [^1]

### Interview Questions
I'm going to start my day, hopefully before working out, with an interview question to learn remind myself of java and design patterns and what not. to make it more specific, I will try to finish the problem in the first hour then the last half hour I'm going to simulate an interview question. i might record it just to make it more realistic. 

### Workout
Then right after, I'm going to go for a run then the gym. 

### Learning Unity
After that, I'm going to try to learn something Unity related. Anything. This will give me some time to rest my legs as well as to learn something useful that I might still use for the game.

### The Game
After that, I'm going to continue with the game, this includes the art and I'm going to try to do it standing because its very difficult to work while sitting. 

###  Learning Unreal Engine
And Lastly, I will look a little into Unreal Engine since that is my target engine for the Jobs I want to apply to after I'm done with the game.

# Versions
need to find a version to check the 2D lights.  I'm thinking it might not work since I'm using 3D ground with 2D sprites. 

**CCv2**

**CCv3**

**CCv4**

**CCv5**
Has the minimalist 2D game with the coins system and the simple enemies.

**CCv6**
previous final version with incomplete stages.

**CCv7**
good controllers for slow pace.

**CCv8**
Main Menu with game intro cutscene and a few other cutscenes. I will use this one to test my the Lights, 2D and 3D. As well as the Blur effects for foreground things as well as.
- Main Menu
- Long Jump and Push/pull
- Slow pace
- Lights (2D and 3D)
- Blur

**CCv9 (current)**
Level 1 to 3 with intro cutscenes.

**CCv10**
All about mobile and URP. Then I might need to redo some assets

**CCv11**
The point of this iteration is to work on the game itself. In other words what is the purpose of the game, where is the player going and why. So the goal of the player is to reach the end of the level and they are going to do that by unlocking it with 10 coins that are going to be hidden somewhere in the level. No keys needed just coins to make it simple.

I'm thinking using a GameManager to do it but I'm not entirely sure what they are used for. As the video said, they are meant have a reference of every part of the game. as well as keep track of things so I'm going to do just that.
