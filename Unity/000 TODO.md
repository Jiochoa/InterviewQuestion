## Monthly Plan
By the end of the month I want a playable game. From start to finish, even if i have to use dubs. The first week will be only connecting everything with a switch scene triggers. The second week I will focus mainly in cutscenes( at least thats the plan but I will have to readjust for upcoming quality like fog). The third week I want 5 minutes of each level. The last week I will be doing the Main Menu and the credit scenes.
### November Plans

- [ ] **Week 1:** Connect everything with triggers.
- [ ] **Week 2:** All cutscenes
- [ ] **Week 3:** Enlarge levels to make them 5 minutes+
- [ ] **Week 4:** Main Menus and Credit scene

Note: I'm still planning to work in iterations but that will have to wait a little bit until I get my shit together.

## The Plan
Bit of a change in pace since i getting board and I feel i need some variation.

- Interview questions
- Learning something new in Unity[^2]
- The Game
- Learning something in Unreal Engine [^1]

### Interview Questions
I'm going to start my day, hopefully before working out, with an interview question to learn remind myself of java and design patterns and what not. to make it more specific, I will try to finish the problem in the first hour then the last half hour I'm going to simulate an interview question. i might record it just to make it more realistic. 

### Workout
Then right after, I'm going to go for a run then the gym. 

### Learning Unity
After that, I'm going to try to learn something Unity related. Anything. This will give me some time to rest my legs as well as to learn something useful that I might still use for the game.

### The Game
After that, I'm going to continue with the game, this includes the art and I'm going to try to do it standing because its very difficult to work while sitting. 

###  Learning Unreal Engine
And Lastly, I will look a little into Unreal Engine since that is my target engine for the Jobs I want to apply to after I'm done with the game.

# Versions
need to find a version to check the 2D lights.  I'm thinking it might not work since I'm using 3D ground with 2D sprites. 

**CCv2**

**CCv3**

**CCv4**

**CCv5**
Has the minimalist 2D game with the coins system and the simple enemies.

**CCv6**
previous final version with incomplete stages.

**CCv7**
good controllers for slow pace.

**CCv8**
Main Menu with game intro cutscene and a few other cutscenes. I will use this one to test my the Lights, 2D and 3D. As well as the Blur effects for foreground things as well as.
- Main Menu
- Long Jump and Push/pull
- Slow pace
- Lights (2D and 3D)
- Blur

**CCv9 (current)**
Level 1 to 3 with intro cutscenes.

**CCv10**
All about mobile and URP. Then I might need to redo some assets

**CCv11**
The point of this iteration is to work on the game itself. In other words what is the purpose of the game, where is the player going and why. So the goal of the player is to reach the end of the level and they are going to do that by unlocking it with 10 coins that are going to be hidden somewhere in the level. No keys needed just coins to make it simple.

I'm thinking using a GameManager to do it but I'm not entirely sure what they are used for. As the video said, they are meant have a reference of every part of the game. as well as keep track of things so I'm going to do just that.
