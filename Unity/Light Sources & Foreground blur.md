## Lights & Glow

Requires;
- UniversalRP

### Setup
Trying to make Lights, 2D or 3D. Need to **create** a `Pipeline Asset` for the URP. Then set it up in Edit > Project Settings > Graphics then assign it at the top. 

Everything should turn Pink so they need to be upgraded. to fix, `Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal > Upgrade to URP Materials`

Now, make sure the project uses the 2D Renderer: To do that we **create** a `2D Renderer` and assign it to the Pipeline we created earlier.

### How to Use
Everything should turn black so we will need to **create** some 2D lights. There's a few to choose from. One if Point light which is just a lamp or free-form light thta lets us shape the illuminated areas.

The lights can be adjusted with inner and outer angles. We can also add layer to ignore as well as light order.
Free-Form can be shaped. As for why? Not sure yet. we could use it to light up the Player so they always know where they're at. 

Sprite-Light. With this one we can pick a different shape like spots lie those done when the sun is on top of a tree.
