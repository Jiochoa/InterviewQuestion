This is a skeleton/reference for a game design concept. Your full design documents will be much longer!
## High Level Concept/Design
### Working title
Your game’s title should communicate the gameplay and the style of the game

Right now the title is <u>Cybr_Cat</u> it would only change if there's another game with similar name but i doubt it.
### Concept statements
The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say what the game is and why it’s fun.

The player takes control of a cat trying to make friends with another cat while following him around while solving puzzles trough a cyberpunk style city
### Genre(s)
Single genre is clearer but often less interesting. Genre combinations can be risky. Beware of ‘tired’ genres.

single-player 2D puzzle-adventure game
### Target audience
Motivations and relevant interests; potentially age, gender, etc.; and the desired ESRB rating for the game.

Cyberpunk style, futuristic. Rated for Everyone
### Unique Selling points
Critically important. What makes your game stand out? How is it different from all other games?

The game's meant to have a relaxing mood with intuitive story telling and a big revelation at the end, and futuristic art style. Perfect for relaxing after work. As of uniqueness, for now it will be the art but I'm thinking of adding some unique mechanics
## Product Design
### Player Experience and Game POV
Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the player? What emotions do
you want the player to feel? What keeps the player engaged for the duration of their play?

The player will take control of a cat in a cyberpunk setting where A.I. has become so cheap that practically every device uses it.

I want the player to feel a sense of wonder in a giant city with multiple things happening in the background. I want a living city while the player tries to solve a puzzle. The game will keeps the player's interest by getting closer and closer to the other cat as well as a gaining a better understanding of the world around it.
### Visual and Audio style
What is the “look and feel” of the game? How does this support the desired player’s experience? What
concept art or reference art can you show to give the feel of the game?

The best look I could think of is Limbo, I want their style on my game. Kind of dark and gloomy with monsters (TBD)

### Game World Fiction
Briefly describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms (as presented to the player).

### Monetization
How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this within the design?

### Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief)
PC or mobile? Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript? How long to make, and how big a team?
How long to first-playable? How long to complete the game? Major risks?


## Detailed & Game Systems Design
### Core Loops
How do game objects and the player’s actions form loops? Why is this engaging? How does this support
player goals? What emergent results do you expect/hope to see? If F2P, where are the monetization points?

### Objectives and Progression
How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from tutorial to end? What are their
short-term and long-term goals (explicit or implicit)? How do these support the game concept, style, and
player-fantasy?

### Game Systems
What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation, etc.) and which does the
player interact with?

### Interactivity
How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog, Emotional, Social, Cultural)
What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does the player move through the world? How does
physics/combat/etc. work? A clear, professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful.
