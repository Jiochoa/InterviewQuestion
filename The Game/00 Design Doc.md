## High Level Concept/Design
### Working title
Right now the title is <u>Cybr_Cat</u> it would only change if there's another game with similar name but i doubt it.
### Concept statements
The player takes control of a cat trying to make friends with another cat while following him around while solving puzzles trough a cyberpunk style city
### Genre(s)
single-player 2D puzzle-adventure game
### Target audience
Cyberpunk style, futuristic. Rated for Everyone
### Unique Selling points
The game's meant to have a relaxing mood with intuitive story telling and a big revelation at the end, and futuristic art style. Perfect for relaxing after work. As of uniqueness, for now it will be the art but I'm thinking of adding some unique mechanics
## Product Design
### Player Experience and Game POV
The player will take control of a cat in a cyberpunk setting where A.I. has become so cheap that practically every device uses it.
I want the player to feel a sense of wonder in a giant city with multiple things happening in the background. I want a living city while the player tries to solve a puzzle. The game will keeps the player's interest by getting closer and closer to the other cat as well as a gaining a better understanding of the world around it.
### Visual and Audio style
The best look I could think of is Limbo, I want their style on my game. Kind of dark and gloomy with monsters (TBD)
