New focus plan. I think tutorials are still good so I'm going to do that more. Also need to apply so that's still on the table. What's off the table is the Kotlin  application. I plan to do 3 Pomodoro for each

- Jobs:
	- Apply to 5 jobs
	- interview questions
- Unity3D game
- Tutorials:
	- factory pattern
- Python 100 days of code

That's what is important right now so I need to schedule accordingly.

1. Interview questions (standing)
2. Workout (3 - 3:30 AM park/ 4 - 5 Gym)
3. Work
	- Apply (sitting)
	- Sell (standing)
4. Unity3D (standing)
5. Tutorial (sitting)

Need to revise this plan and include some arising constrains like the fact that I cant use my diploma anymore as a main focus. Doesn't mean its useless but I can't have it at the top. I also need to revise where I want to work at. I think I'm still leaning towards cyber security so I might need some course for that, as well as certificates. 

note: the most important part should be the first thing I do after waking up. 

Things I want in my resume:

- The game
- Programming tutorials
- Cybersecurity certificate
- Current jobs
	- need to arrange it to make it look good on whatever I'm applying to
