## What I need to do?
Getting a job is important but I'm afraid it might be too late now to apply as is. What I could do is finish the game I'm making then use that as leverage / excuse for current projects. 

So that was quick. Tried unreal engine then notice the work flow for 2d animations and it would be a headache to do a 2d game in there. 

maybe unity is not that bad for 2d games I'm still figuring it out.

### Game
I remember this guy saying that there is a good income in making video games but I might be too new for that. So in other words, the game is priority. 

### Actual career
I also need to to think on the long run, Cybersecurity is what I think I have. so I need certificates? i think. so I need answers to this questions to proceed:

1. What Job am I actually after and what I need to get in

### Interview Questions
Every job I apply to will ask me some technical questions so I need to be able to answer them.

### What I actually need to do
I remember that is important working on important things in the morning (whenever I wake up) which will be the most important thing I do all day. I can switch around on that but the "most important thing I'll do today" has to be just after waking up. maybe just a coffee but definitely not food because I don't know why.

#### Work on the game
the first round will be about figuring out what I need. I forgotten a lot of things so I need a reminder.

I will start with this for now, then ill do the career stuff then the interview question. I'm aiming for one a day but I guess ill have to adjust. It has to be professional so I'm also thinking in making a video with the answer, maybe not publish it but the practice is definitely needed
