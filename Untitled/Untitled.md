New focus plan. I think tutorials are still good so I'm going to do that more. Also need to apply so that's still on the table. What's off the table is the Kotlin  application. I plan to do 3 Pomodoro for each

- Jobs:
	- Apply to 5 jobs
	- interview questions
- Unity3D game
- Tutorials:
	- factory pattern
	- Kotlin?
- Python 100 days of code

That's what is important right now so I need to schedule accordingly.

1. Interview questions (standing)
2. Workout (3 - 3:30 AM park/ 4 - 5 Gym)
3. Work
	- Apply (sitting)
	- Sell (standing)
4. Unity3D (standing)
5. Tutorial (sitting)
